# TexCells
A Game in Excel

Use the arrow keys - that's about all you need to know!
Press ESC to exit.
Note: this game remaps keyboard keys in Excel. You need to remove the mapping by pressing ESC or restarting Excel to use Excel normally.

If you want to add audio, the second line of code in the macro needs to be uncommented and the path to the wav audio file included inbetween the quotation marks.
